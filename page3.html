<p> This project was conceived with the inspiration of the book "The secret lives of color". I was given the prompt of using multiple colors merging with different textures. I decided on a hazy and ambient atmosphere where the colors would truthfully stand out amongst the background. I think this assignment was very successful in its display of color along with texture. </p>
