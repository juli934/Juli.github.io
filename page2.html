<p> When working on this piece I was given the prompt of creating a landscape of a good dream. I immediately began top imagine the things I find most comforting in my life. These thoughts gave way to this creation that includes the use of jellyfish and clouds merging as one. I find this piece to be very comforting and very successful with the feeling I was intending. </p>
