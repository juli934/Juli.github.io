    While working on this project I immediately knew I wanted a theme revolving around womanhood. I proceeded by entering my prompt into a text generator that met me with the themes of style, purity, and vanity. These became my main inspirations for the project and allowed me to gather materials based on these. I wanted my collage to almost seem like a teenage girls diary that you shouldn't be in. All of my images were collected from Rawpixel.
